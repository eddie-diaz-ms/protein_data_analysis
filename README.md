# Exploring Tabular Data with Protein Powders

## Description

These Jupyter notebooks provide visualization and modeling techniques to study tabular data. The goal is to create a classifier for protein powder products that can be used to better target a specific target customer. This was one of my first machine learning projects for my SMU master's and it would provide foundational work for other projects like MyProteinIntake.
